	<h1>Hi, I'm Rana</h1>

	<p class="about">     Flowers play a larger part in our lives than we realize.  They help us celebrate at anniversaries, birthdays and weddings.  They mourn with us at a loved one's funeral.  They are a kind gesture from a significant other.  I believe flowers that are with us at emotional events take on the memories of the events themselves; they represent them, they are symbols of them.  They are what remain when the event has passed.</p>  

	<p class="about">     When flowers start to fade, it often feels as though the memories they signify fade as well.  What I aim to do is to prevent that fading; to preserve those charished memories.  I want to create something that speaks to your heart.  Something that won't age or change.  Something that will stay perfectly preserved, just as your memories will.  Something to cherish and hold dear.</p>

	<p class="about">     My love of crafting with flowers started 15 years ago.  Guided by my mother, I started to dry them and arrange them in shadowboxes.  It was for my own enjoyment at first, but then I realized I could do so much more with it than just serve myself - I could serve others.  I reached out.  I started doing them for friend's weddings, funerals, birthdays, you name it.  I loved it.  Seeing the joy on their faces was pricelesss.  I started with only doing shadowboxes, but soon I was branching out into making bracelets and bookmarks and, later on, earrings, keychains and more.</p>  

	<p class="about">     What started as gifts for friends and family turned into a small business that gets spread around by word of mouth.  I've had people as far as California and New York contact me asking for keepsakes of their own.  I believe that what I create resonates with people on a level that can't be reached with something from a store.  I believe that flowers are more important than we think, stronger than we realize and more than they appear.</p>
